Welcome to intergalactics!
<P>
To play, you'll need to do one of these things:
<UL>
 <LI>
   Go to 
   <A HREF="http://intergalactics.">http://intergalactics.net</A>, and play over the web. This
   is the easiest way to get started, so I recommend this first. Requires Internet Explorer 4.0 (or greater), or Netscape 4.5 (or greater).
 <LI>
   If you have Windows 98 or Internet Explorer 4 (or greater) then you're all set.
   Make sure you connected to the Internet, and type:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>intergalactics ie intergalactics.net</CODE>
<P>
   (Or substitute a different server for intergalactics.net)
 <LI>
   Otherwise, you'll have to download the Java Runtime Environment from Sun. Go
   here to do that: <A HREF="http://www.java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/jre/index.html">http://www.java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/jre/index.html</A>. Then type:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>intergalactics intergalactics.net</CODE>
<P>
</UL>

 Read the online docs available at <A HREF="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~jw/intergalactics">http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~jw/intergalactics</A> for further assistance.

/**
 * The DiploBot is an arrogant little Bot that tries to set up alliances with
 * players (with no particular plan in mind). It will being to distrust those
 * it allies with until a certain (unknown) breaking point at which it breaks
 * off the alliance. After war has been declared, it takes a while to get back
 * on the Diplobot's good side.
 *
 * You can attempt to ally with a Diplobot on your own accord. However, beware
 * because Diplobots can often be insulted by such a request and become even
 * more distrustful.
 *
 * Meanwhile, the Diplobot is an extremely overzealous neutral expander. It is
 * somewhat LucasBotish in its tactics.

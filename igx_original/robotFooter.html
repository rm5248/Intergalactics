    <P>Here's a brief explanation of what you're looking at:
    <UL>
     <LI>This graph is the result of an enormous round-robin tournament where for
      each galaxy, a game was played using every possible permutation of robots 
      over the home planets. This is the most thorough method of testing
      robot-to-robot combat I could think of!
     <LI>The <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Rank</FONT> column indicates the overall
      ranking of each robot. <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Win%</FONT> is the percentage
      of games the robot won.
     <LI>Each column under the <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Game Size %</FONT> category
      represents the win percentage of the robot in games with the given number
      of players.
     <LI>Lastly, the columns corresponding to other robots indicate the relative
      number of wins versus losses scored with that robot.
